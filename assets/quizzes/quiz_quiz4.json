      "question": "Why do we use Gel electrophoresis to separate mixtures of DNA, RNA, or proteins according to molecular size?",
      "choices": [
        "In gel electrophoresis, the molecules to be separated are pulled by an electrical field through a gel that contains small pores.",
        "In gel electrophoresis, the molecules to be separated are not pulled by an electrical field through a gel that contains small pores.",
        "In gel electrophoresis, the molecules to be separated are pushed by an electrical field through a gel that contains small pores.",

      ],
      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Gel electrophoresis is a laboratory method used to separate mixtures of DNA, RNA, or proteins according to molecular size. In gel electrophoresis, the molecules to be separated are pushed by an electrical field through a gel that contains small pores."

        "Polymerase Chain Reaction",
        "genetic cloning",
        "viral vector",
        "Gel Electrophoresis"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Polymerase chain reaction is a method widely used to rapidly make millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample, allowing scientists to take a very small sample of DNA and amplify it to a large enough amount to study in detail."

      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an animal, plant, or microbe whose DNA has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. For thousands of years, humans have used breeding methods to modify organisms. Corn, cattle, and even dogs have been selectively bred over generations to have certain desired traits."

      "question": "Why does antisense oligonucleotide,  as a single stranded RNA, should be complementary to a protein coding messenger RNA (mRNA)? ",
      "choices": [
        "It hybridizes, and thereby blocks its translation into protein.",
        "It does not hybridizes its translation into protein.",
        "It hybridizes, but does not block its translation into protein.",
        "It only blocks its translation into protein."
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Antisense RNA (asRNA), also referred to as antisense transcript, natural antisense transcript (NAT) or antisense oligonucleotide,  is a single stranded RNA that is complementary to a protein coding messenger RNA (mRNA) with which it hybridizes, and thereby blocks its translation into protein."

    {
      "question": "Why do viral vectors are used as tools by molecular biologists to deliver genetic material into cells?",
      "choices": [
        "Because this process can be performed outside a living organism or in cell culture.",
        "Because this process can be performed on the environment of a living organism or in cell culture.",
        "Because this process can be performed inside a living organism or in cell culture.",
        "Because this process can be performed on the habitat of a living organism or in cell culture."
      ],
      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Viral vectors are tools commonly used by molecular biologists to deliver genetic material into cells. This process can be performed inside a living organism or in cell culture."

      "question": "Do you think it is helpful if you use a cloning vector , a plasmid to carry the target DNA from one location to another?",
      "choices": [
        "No. It is not helpful to use a cloning vector, typically a plasmid or virus, it is not capable of independent replication.",
        "No. It is not helpful to use a cloning vector, typically a plasmid or virus, it is not able in capable replication that will stably carry the target DNA from one location to another.",
        "Yes. It is helpful to use a cloning vector, typically a plasmid or virus, capable of independent replication that will stably carry the target DNA from one location to another.",
        "Yes. It is helpful to use a cloning vector, typically a plasmid or virus, though it is not capable of independent replication, it is still helpful."
      ],
      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "The green fluorescent protein (GFP) commonly used as an expression marker in molecular techniques was originally isolated from jellyfish. In cloning a gene it is helpful to use a cloning vector, typically a plasmid or virus, capable of independent replication that will stably carry the target DNA from one location to another. Plasmid vectors are available from both bacteria and yeast."
